# show_recommender_app

An application made in Dart and Flutter that recommends different TV shows, movies, cartoons and anime to the user based on their input. It has one simple user flow and doesn't require signing in or creating an account. 

There are a lot of improvements that I want to make and the project isn't that close to release (as an MVP). 

I'll finish this after I have more time in my hands.
